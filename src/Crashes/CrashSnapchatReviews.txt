List of Crash Reviews:
1. What possess you to give a notification when someone is typing? Who asked for that? It's unnecessary and annoying. We don't need two notifications for every message received. The least you could do is allow us to turn it off if we don't want that. Addition: Now it keeps crashing after watching even a single story. Not to mention that if anyone posts while I'm viewing something, it starts glitching and crashes on itself. Snapchat is quickly becoming obsolete, and you only have yourself to blame.,

2. I love using Snapchat to talk to my friends and engage with others. The only gripe I have currently is somewhat of a bug. People complained when the back button was moved next to the call button and then it was moved back to the other side. Mine is still on the right side near the call but my other friends have it on the opposite side. If I can somehow fix this, I'll change my rating to 5 stars ðŸŒŸ.,
