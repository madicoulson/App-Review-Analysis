# Support Vector Machine Algorithm Utilized to Classify Snapchat App Store Reviews as Actionable or Non-Actionable, and Further to Action Type

To run any of the SVMs, you simply just need to run the Python file corresponding with the desired SVM. Each general SVM file is named SVM<type>.py. The file with the corresponding SVM used to test the Snapchat data is named SVM<type>Snapchat.py. For example, the general Actionable SVM is SVMActionable.py, and the Actionable SVM with the Snapchat data is SVMActionableSnapchat.py. Along with this, each file is in a specific file in src labeled with they type of SVM (Actionable, Crashes, Security, Speed, User Interface).

Please see the paper SVM For App Review Analysis for further detail.
