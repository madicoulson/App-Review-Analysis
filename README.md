# Support Vector Machine Algorithm Utilized to Classify Snapchat App Store Reviews as Actionable or Non-Actionable, and Further to Action Type

## The steps of this project, which each will be described in greater detail, are as follows:
### Step 1. Develop a SVM with over 90% accuracy to test Snapchat app store data.
#### researched model libraries, created model based upon ChatGPT, manually wrote and had ChatGPT auto generate sample data, got it up to 98% accuracy

### Step 2. Pull real reviews on Snapchat from the Google Play Store.
#### used Google play instead of app store, pulled 100 reviews and stored in Python list

### Step 3. Run the SVM on the set of Snapchat reviews and create a list of those that are actionable. 
### found 33 out of the 100 were actionable items

### Step 4. Develop seperate SVM models for reviews that correspond with the following issues: speed, crashes, UI/UX, security

### Step 5. Run the actionable data on the 4 seperate SVM models to determine which type of action should be taken.
