# Support Vector Machine Algorithm Utilized to Classify Snapchat App Store Reviews as Actionable or Non-Actionable, 
# and Further to Action Type

## The steps of this project, which each will be described in greater detail, are as follows:
## 1. Develop a SVM with over 90% accuracy to test Snapchat app store data.
## 2. Pull real reviews on Snapchat from the Google Play Store.
## 3. Run the SVM on the set of Snapchat reviews and create a list of those that are actionable. 
## 4. Develop seperate SVM models for reviews that correspond with the following issues: speed, crashes, UI/UX, security
## 5. Run the actionable data on the 4 seperate SVM models to determine which type of action should be taken.

### Step 1: Develop initial SVM
### The first step necessary ...
